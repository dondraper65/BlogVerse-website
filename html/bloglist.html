He wore a green beret with two rows of little white and red squares at the bottom, and a thick black belt. His lips were thin and he looked around the classroom with disdain. “This is Miss Cheskin,” said Miss Hughes, gesticulating to the woman. “She’s here to talk about a career in retail sales.” The woman stepped to the front and gave a bright smile. “So, how many of you like the idea of working in a department store? Hands up.” A plain spotty girl, Ruth Smith, lifted a fat arm up. “Wouldn’t mind.” “I wouldn’t want to be served by you!” said Johnny Harris. The class laughed. “That’s enough, Harris,” snapped Miss Hughes. “Please carry on, Miss Cheskin.” Miss Cheskin carried on, “Well, I’ve been</p>

                                    <p class="card-text para">Originally built nearly two hundred years earlier, the substantial farmhouse had withstood all weathers. Until now. Yasmin Hill looked back in the distance to the roof just visible above the floodwater, then to Tom, his old face furrowed in concentration beneath the miner’s helmet as he rowed them out further and further away from her home, or what had been her home.
                                        “We’re at sea now, young ‘un,” he said after a while.
                                        The sky was the colour of mud and heavy drops of rain fell intermittently, spattering Yasmin’s thin bare legs and anorak, the hood pulled tight over her blonde hair. “How do you know?”
                                        The rain ran in rivulets down Tom’s helmet, then were soaked up by the collar of an old duffle coat. “I can tell by the tide, it’s growing stronger.”
                                        Tom began to turn the little boat in a quarter circle, the old knotted wood of the oars digging into the heavy green water, throwing up salty spray which from time to time blew into Yasmin’s face so that she could taste it on her tongue and lips. It reminded her of the little blue twists that came in bags of crisps. “I’m frightened, Tom. And cold.”
                                        Tom began to pull harder on the oars. “Don’t you worry, lass, just a couple of miles down the coast and we’ll hit the shore. The land rises up and the floods won’t have reached it.”</p>

Her face could be attractive, he thought, if it weren’t stained with dirt and what looked like tears, judging from her swollen eyes. He steadied himself against the swaying cabin door. “What’s your name?”
                                        She wore an old green smock, faded and stained, and grey woollen leggings. On her right hand she wore a plain gold band. “It’s … it’s Sarah.”</p>

It is an open-source, component-based front end library responsible only for the view layer of the application. It was created by Jordan Walke, who was a software engineer at Facebook. It was initially developed and maintained by Facebook and was later used in its products like WhatsApp & Instagram. Facebook developed ReactJS in 2011 in its newsfeed section, but it was released to the public in the month of May 2013.</p>
