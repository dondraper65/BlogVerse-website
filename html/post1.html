            <p  id = "main-para"class="para">When the Internet boomed with public usage in the 1990s, technology companies battled to build the most powerful and efficient web browser on the market. This sparked the first “browser war,” between Microsoft (Internet Explorer) and NetScape (NetScape Navigator) to gain dominance in the usage share of web browsers. Netscape needed a lightweight scripting language for easier programming. This ultimately made web development more accessible, unlike other languages that required deeper training. In 1995, a NetScape employee, Brendan Eich, was given ten days to help build the company a lightweight scripting language. As a result, Eich built Mocha, which was later renamed JavaScript. The moral of the story—JavaScript was never intended to become the standard language for the web! However, after NetScape was acquired by AOL and eventually turned over their browser's code to the Mozilla Foundation, the popularity of JavaScript grew. JavaScript is now an essential web technology that’s supported by the most popular web browsers. Familiarity with the language is crucial for anyone who wants to become a web developer—that's why it's been the most commonly used programming language in Stack Overflow's Developer Survey for six years in a row. In the early 2000s, big platforms like Facebook and Google began using JavaScript to program the back-end. JavaScript helped businesses scale since engineers who knew JavaScript could apply those skills in server-side contexts. Server-side JavaScript gained popularity because it allowed for the scalability needed in cloud computing and the back-end. In the server, JavaScript can be integrated with other languages to communicate with databases. Browsers have engines that can process JavaScript quickly, and this has encouraged more server-side usage. Node.JS, or Node, is one of the most popular versions of server-side JavaScript. Node has been used to write large platforms for NASA, eBay and many others. Since Javascript can execute programs out of order, Node can use it to create scalable web applications, messaging platforms, and multiplayer games. This is why Google Cloud and Amazon Web Service depend on Node for some of their services. When diving into either programming or web development, JavaScript is an excellent language to learn. The capabilities of JavaScript allow you to use it in many different fields, from programming to web development. Mastering what is known as “vanilla” or plain JavaScript will help you to tackle more complicated frameworks and libraries to make you a competitive developer.</p>
